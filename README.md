# Getting Started with GitHub
[Remote Repository](https://github.com/chrkis7/PhotoGallery/)

1. Create GitHub user and let Chris knows your email address, so he will add you as a collaborator.
2. Generate a new SSH key and adding it to the ssh-agent and adding the new ssh key to your GitHub account. [Connecting to GitHub with SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)
3. Set up a local repo by forking the Remote repository. [Forking a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo)
4. Make sure you checkout the master branch, pulls the latest commits and resets the repo's local copy of master to match the latest version.
5. Create a feature branch based on the master branch.
6. Work with your part with your favorite code editor.
7. Once the work is done, select changes to include in a commit.
8. Push changes to your local repository.
9. Create a pull request.

#### I know it might overwhlem you, I was there too before. If then, we can just do our work indivisually for now and send your work to someone to finish it. And I will add the changes to GitHub. But you will follow this work flow, once you become a web dev :)
